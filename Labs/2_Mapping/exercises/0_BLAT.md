# Mapping Warmup: BLAT

BLAT is an incredible useful tool to have in ones bioinformatics tool kit. If you are already familiar with it then skip this exercise. If you have never used it then get some practice with it. 

In
```
	$ROOT45/Labs/2_Mapping/data/exercise_2_1_blat.fasta
```

are FASTA sequences from the Human genome. Determine what they are using BLAT (http://genome.ucsc.edu). They are from build hg19. Note; UCSC has now switch over to hg38 as the default. You could probably BLAT these sequences against that build but practice setting the correct genome build.
