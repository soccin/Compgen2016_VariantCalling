## SHRiMP Mapping Program

* Find, install and use the SHRiMP mapping program to map any of the datasets previously used or your own data

* CAUTION: SHRiMP is much, much slower then the previous ones. 

## wgsim

Generate your own test data and test how different settings affect mapping

You can find a copy of wgsim here:
```

```

Read the README and follow the Compliation instructions. Then read the rest of the README and the help screen for the program. Is is pretty simple but fairly quick.
