# Unix tutorials on the web:

These were the top sites when I did a google search for: Unix beginner tutorial or Unix tutorial

- UNIX Tutorial for Beginners: (http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
  I would just look at 1-4 and stop there for now.
  
  There is a version off line in the repository at:
  
```
	$ROOT/Intro2NextGen/0_Intro2Unix/tutorials/unixtut/index.html
```
  
  Open in a web browser

- Unix Tutorial: http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kevin/unix-tutorial/toc.html
  I would do sections 1,3,4,5(ignore pico),8,9,10,12
  
- UNIX Tutorial: (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/)
  Nice content but way too many advertisements and pages to click
  

- Learn UNIX in 10 minutes (http://freeengineer.org/learnUNIXin10minutes.html)
  Avoid! I found it confusing and difficult to follow
  
- Survival guide for Unix newbies: (http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/)
  Again not recommended.
